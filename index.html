									<p>In conducting a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, I gathered data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's website, 
										uncovering several key insights that shed light on the impact and distribution of the virus.</p>
									<p>ðŸ“‰ As of the time of this analysis, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), stood at 267,000. This figure reflects the widespread reach of the virus across the nation. <br>

										ðŸ“‰ Tragically, the pandemic has resulted in a total of 3,155 recorded deaths in Nigeria. This sobering statistic emphasizes the severity and consequences of the health crisis on the population. <br>

										ðŸ“‰ Lagos, maintaining its position as the epicenter of the disease, reported the highest number of both confirmed cases and deaths. This concentration highlights the challenges faced by densely populated urban areas and underscores the need for targeted interventions in such regions.
										<p>This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria, 
										offering valuable insights for informed decision-making and targeted interventions to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
